"What are smart contracts in the context of blockchain?","Smart contracts are essentially programs deployed on a blockchain. They are neither 'smart' nor 'contracts' but rather code and instructions that are executed based on specific inputs."
"How can users interact with smart contracts?","Users can interact with smart contracts by initiating blockchain transactions containing execution data (which function to call and with what input)."
"How do smart contracts modify and interact with blockchain storage?","Smart contracts can modify and read the storage of the underlying blockchain."
"Do smart contracts have their own addresses on the blockchain?","Yes, a smart contract has its own address and is considered a blockchain account, meaning it can hold tokens."
"Are smart contracts limited to a single programming language?","No, the programming language used to write smart contracts varies depending on the blockchain. For instance, on Ethereum, it's Solidity, while on Starknet, it's Cairo."
"How is Solidity code compiled for Ethereum?","On Ethereum, Solidity is compiled into bytecode."
"What are the characteristics of smart contracts?","Smart contracts are permissionless, transparent, and can be composable. They can only access and interact with data from the blockchain they are deployed on and require third-party software (oracles) to access external data."
"Can you name two widely used Ethereum smart contract standards?","Two widely used standards are the ERC20, for tokens like USDC, DAI or STARK, and the ERC721, for NFTs like CryptoPunks or Everai."
"What is DeFi in the context of blockchain and smart contracts?","DeFi (decentralized finance) refers to decentralized financial applications that no longer rely on traditional financial intermediaries. It consists of projects like lending/borrowing apps, decentralized exchanges (DEX), on-chain derivatives, stablecoins, decentralized hedge funds, insurance, etc."
"What is tokenization in the context of smart contracts?","Tokenization divides real-world assets, such as real estate or art, into digital tokens, which can be traded and managed on blockchain platforms."
"How can smart contracts be used in voting?","Smart contracts can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems, where votes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency. The smart contract can then automatically tally the votes and declare the results."
"How can smart contracts handle royalty payments?","Smart contracts can automate royalty payments. When content is consumed or sold, the smart contract can automatically calculate and distribute the royalties to the rightful owners."
"What are decentralized identities (DIDs) in the context of smart contracts?","Decentralized identities (DIDs) are digital identities created and managed using smart contracts, allowing individuals to control their personal information and securely share it with third parties."
"What issue did Ethereum face with the rapid adoption of use cases like DeFi?","With the rapid adoption of use cases like DeFi, the cost of performing transactions on Ethereum became extremely high, rendering the network almost unusable."
"What does the Blockchain Trilemma state?","The Blockchain Trilemma states that it's impossible to achieve a high level of scalability, decentralization, and security simultaneously; trade-offs must be made."
"What is Starknet's approach to resolving Ethereum's scalability issues?","Starknet uses validity rollups, a type of Layer 2 (L2) solution, which use cryptography to prove that the new state of a batched set of transactions has been correctly computed."
"What is the primary purpose of STARKs in the context of Starknet?","STARKs are cryptographic technology that permits validity rollups, like Starknet, to prove the correctness of computations from one state to another, allowing them to scale significantly."
"What is Cairo in relation to STARKs?","Cairo is a language developed specifically to work with STARKs and make them general-purpose, allowing for the writing of provable code."
"How does Starknet differ from most of its competitors in terms of its foundational layer?","Unlike most of Starknet's competitors that use the EVM (either as-is or adapted) as a base layer, Starknet employs its own VM."
"What are 'Smart Accounts' in the context of Starknet and Cairo?","Smart Accounts are more complex logic accounts, enabled by native account abstraction in Starknet and Cairo, which allow for unique transaction flows."
"How are Cairo programs and Starknet contracts related?","Starknet contracts are a special superset of Cairo programs. A Cairo program must always have a function 'main' as its entry point, and Starknet contracts can run on the Starknet OS, having access to Starknet's state."
"For a module to be treated as a contract by the compiler in Starknet, what annotation is required?","For a module to be handled as a contract by the compiler, it must be annotated with the #[starknet::contract] attribute."
"How do you define the entry point for a Cairo program?","A Cairo program must always have a function 'main' that serves as the entry point for this program."
"Why might the term 'smart contract' be considered misleading?","The term 'smart contract' is somewhat misleading as they are neither 'smart' nor 'contracts' but rather code and instructions executed based on specific inputs."
"How is Cairo compiled for Starknet?","On Starknet, Cairo is compiled into Sierra and then into Cairo Assembly (casm)."
"How can smart contracts be used in the context of real estate?","Smart contracts can facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets, like real estate. This can increase liquidity, enable fractional ownership, and simplify the buying and selling process."
"What is the difference between optimistic rollups and validity rollups?","For optimistic rollups, the new state is considered valid by default with a window for nodes to identify malicious transactions. Validity rollups, like Starknet, use cryptography to prove that the new state has been correctly computed."
"How does Starknet handle the Blockchain Trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and security?","Starknet uses validity rollups and cryptographic technology (STARKs) to achieve scalability while maintaining security. It offloads complex computations to Layer 2 solutions while using Ethereum as a secure settlement layer."
