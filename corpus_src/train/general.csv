"What is the naming convention for functions in cairo ?","Cairo code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
"
"How do I assert ?","You can use the keyword assert.

The syntax is: assert(condition,'condition not met'
"
"create an assert that ensures x is 0","
    assert(x == 0, 'Balance is not 0 ');

Explanation:
- These line of code will assert if x is different from 0
"
"Give an example of variable scope","
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = 'hello';   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }  
    // s is not valid here

Explanations:
- When s comes into scope, it is valid.
- It remains valid until it goes out of scope.

"how do I define a mutable references","
    #[derive(Copy, Drop)]
    struct Rectangle {
        height: u64,
        width: u64,
    }

    fn foo(ref rec: Rectangle)
    {
    }

Explanations:
- In Cairo, a parameter can be passed as mutable reference using the ref modifier.
"
"Give an example of usage for ref","
use debug::PrintTrait;
#[derive(Copy, Drop)]
struct Rectangle {
    height: u64,
    width: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let mut rec = Rectangle { height: 3, width: 10 };
    flip(ref rec);
    rec.height.print();
    rec.width.print();
}

fn flip(ref rec: Rectangle) {
    let temp = rec.height;
    rec.height = rec.width;
    rec.width = temp;
}

Explanation:
-First, we change rec to be mut. Then we pass a mutable reference of rec into flip with ref rec, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with ref rec: Rectangle. This makes it very clear that the flip function will mutate the value of the Rectangle instance passed as parameter.

The output of the program is:

[DEBUG]
                                (raw: 10)
[DEBUG]	                        (raw: 3)
As expected, the height and width fields of the rec variable have been swapped.

"what is Cairo","Cairo is the programming language for smart contracts on Starknet, the Ethereum ZK-Rollup expansion solution. It is also used for writing provable programs."
"What makes Cairo a special language","With Cairo, we can write provable code. In the context of Starknet, this allows proving the correctness of computations from one state to another.

Unlike most (if not all) of Starknet's competitors that chose to use the EVM (either as-is or adapted) as a base layer, Starknet employs its own VM. This frees developers from the constraints of the EVM, opening up a broader range of possibilities. Coupled with decreased transaction costs, the combination of Starknet and Cairo creates an exciting playground for developers. Native account abstraction enables more complex logic for accounts, that we call 'Smart Accounts', and transaction flows. Emerging use cases include transparent AI and machine learning applications. Finally, blockchain games can be developed entirely on-chain. Starknet has been specifically designed to maximize the capabilities of STARK proofs for optimal scalability."
