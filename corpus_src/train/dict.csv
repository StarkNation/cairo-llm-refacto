"What are dictionaries","Cairo provides in its core library a dictionary-like type. The Felt252Dict<T> data type represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and associated with a corresponding value. This type of data structure is known differently across different programming languages such as maps, hash tables, associative arrays and many others."
"what are dictionaries used for ?","The Felt252Dict<T> type is useful when you want to organize your data in a certain way for which using an Array<T> and indexing doesn't suffice. Cairo dictionaries also allow the programmer to easily simulate the existence of mutable memory when there is none."
"Can I use any type for keys of a dictionary ?","It is normal in other languages when creating a new dictionary to define the data types of both key and value. In Cairo, the key type is restricted to felt252 leaving only the possibility to specify the value data type, represented by T in Felt252Dict<T>."
"define a dictionary called messages","
```
    let mut balances: Felt252Dict<u64> = Default::default();
```
"
"create a dictionary and insert value 100 associated to key 'Alex' and 200 to key 'maria'","
 ```
    let mut dict: Felt252Dict<u64> = Default::default();

    dict.insert('Alex', 100);
    dict.insert('Maria', 200);
```
"
"create a dictionary, add a value associated to key 200, and read the value associated to key 200","
```
     let mut dict: Felt252Dict<u64> = Default::default();

    dict.insert(200, 100);
    let value_read = dict.get(200);
```
"
"what value will I get in x:
    let mut dict: Felt252Dict<u64> = Default::default();

    dict.insert('Alex', 100);
    dict.insert('Maria', 200);

x= let value_read = dict.get('Bob');
"," 'Bob' is not a valid key,if you try to get the value of an inexistent key, from a dictionary you will get 0"
"Can I delete an element from a dictionary","No. There is no way to delete data from a dictionary."
 "what is ownership in Cairo ?","Cairo implements an ownership system to ensure the safety and correctness of its compiled code. The ownership mechanism complements the linear type system, which enforces that objects are used exactly once. This helps prevent common operations that can produce runtime errors, such as illegal memory address references or multiple writes to the same memory address, and ensures the soundness of Cairo programs by checking at compile time that all the dictionaries are squashed."
