question,answer
"where are storage variables stored","storage variables are saved on chain"
"is there a way to save a contract state","Similar to Solidity, Cairo supports contract state variables using storage. They will be recorded on chain."
"How many storage structure can I define","There can be at most one Storage structure per contract, but you can add as many components to the storage structure, as you need."
"declare three storage variables","#
    [storage]
    struct Storage{
        var_felt: felt252,
        var_bool: bool,
        var_uint: u8,
    }
Explanation:
    - The structure is seen as storage thanks to [storage]
    - there can be only one storage structure per contract

"How do I set a state in storage","

    myContractState.myState.write(myValue)

Explanations:
    - We suppose here that we have define a storage struct named myContractState
    - myContractState contains a member myState
    - Each storage variable has two member functions: read()and write()
    - We affect myValue using the write method
