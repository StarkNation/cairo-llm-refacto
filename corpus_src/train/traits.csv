Why does this progam makes an error ?

use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}","

You need to implement the PrintTrait for Rectangle.
Here is an example of how to do it:
 ```
use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}

impl RectanglePrintImpl of PrintTrait<Rectangle> {
    fn print(self: Rectangle) {
        self.width.print();
        self.height.print();
    }
}
 ```
