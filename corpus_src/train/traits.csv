"in cairo, what does this line do: use debug::PrintTrait;","
use debug::PrintTrait

fn main() {
    'Hello, World!'.print();
}

Explanation:

- use debug::PrintTrait declares the use of print
- This allows us to use print on short strings
"
"in cairo, what does this line do ? 'Hello, World!'.print();","
    'Hello, World!'.print();

Explanations:

- The print() function called is a method from the trait PrintTrait. This trait is imported from the Cairo core library, and it defines how to print values to the screen for different data types. In our case, our text is defined as a 'short string', which is an ASCII string that can fit in Cairo's basic data type, which is the felt252 type. By calling Hello, world!'.print(), we're calling the print() method of the felt252 implementation of the PrintTrait trait.the 'Hello, World!' is a short string. We pass this short string as an argument to print(), and the short string is printed to the screen.

Why does this progam makes an error ?

use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}","

You need to implement the PrintTrait for Rectangle.
Here is an example of how to do it:

use debug::PrintTrait;

struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 10, };
    rectangle.print();
}

impl RectanglePrintImpl of PrintTrait<Rectangle> {
    fn print(self: Rectangle) {
        self.width.print();
        self.height.print();
    }
}

Explanation:
- use:
impl RectanglePrintImpl of PrintTrait<Rectangle> { }

to decorate the implementation for the print function you want to implement.
