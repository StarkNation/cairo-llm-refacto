"define an enum Data with a u32 and a u128","
#[derive(Drop)]
enum Data {
    myU32: u32,
    myU128: u128

- An enum Data is defined with the appropriate fields and types
"
"Define an enum Data with a tuple for two u32","

"Give an exemple of a Mail status enum","
#[derive(Drop)]
enum Status{
    Pending:(),
    Processing:(),
    Delivered:(),
    Failed:(),
}

Explanations:
- We have defined an enum called ProductStatus with four variants: Pending, Processing, Delivered, Failed.
- The naming convention is to use PascalCase for enum variants.
- Each variant represents a distinct value of the Status type and is associated with a unit type ()
"
"How one variant can be instantiated?","
#[derive(Drop)]
enum Status{
    Pending:(),
    Processing:(),
    Delivered:(),
    Failed:(),
}

let status = Status::Pending(());

Explanations:
- the Pending variant is affected to status
- Each member is associated with a uint type ()
"
"what does this code do:
#[derive(Drop)]
enum Direction {
    North: (),
    East: (),
    South: (),
    West: (),
}
","
Explanations:
- You have defined an enum called Direction, which includes four members: North, East, South, and West. Each member is associated with a uint type () - it has no associated data.
- You can instantiate it using this syntax:

let direction = Direction::North(());
"
"explain this enum:
enum Message {
    Quit: (),
    Echo: felt252,
    Move: (u128, u128),
}","
Explanations:
- Here, the Message enum has three members: Quit, Echo, and Move, each with different types
- Quit is of type unit - it has no associated data.
- Echo is of type felt252.
- Move is a tuple consisting of two u128 values.
