"What is an array in Cairo?","An array is a collection of elements of the same type."
"How can you utilize array methods?","You can create and use array methods by importing the array::ArrayTrait trait."
"Are arrays versatile in terms of modification options?","No, arrays have limited modifications options."
"What is a key feature of an array in relation to changing its values?","The values of arrays can't be modified."
"If a memory slot is written to, what can and can't you do with it?","Once a memory slot is written to, it cannot be overwritten, but only read from it."
"How can you add new items to an array if the method mentioned is 'append'?","You can only append items to the end of an array."
"how can you remove items from an array?","The method 'pop_front()' removes items from the front of an array."
"How do you create an array?","An array is created with ArrayTrait::new() call."
"How do you indicate the type of items in an array?","You can pass the expected type of items inside the array when instantiating or explicitly define the type the variable."
"how can you include an element to an array?","To add an element to the end of an array, you can use the append() method."

"If an array is empty and you use the 'pop_front()' method, what would it return?","It returns Option::None."
"Given the code 'a.append(10); a.append(1); a.append(2); let first_value = a.pop_front().unwrap(); first_value.print();', what would be the printed output?","It will print '10'."
"Why does the output display10 when the code snippet includes 'a.append(10);' followed by 'a.pop_front().unwrap().print();'?","Because 10 was the first element added to the array, and it gets removed using pop_front()."
"What does it mean for memory to be immutable?","In Cairo, memory cannot be changed once set."
"can you change the existing elements of an array in Cairo?","No, it's not possible to modify the elements of an array once they've been added in Cairo."
"How are elements added or removed from arrays in Cairo without direct memory cell modifications?","These operations involve updating pointers rather than directly modifying the memory cells."
"In Cairo, what type of operation is needed for appending to an array's end or removing from its start,?","These operations do not require memory mutation."
"How would you define a variable's type (u128) when creating an array ?","You can use syntax like
```
    let mut arr:Array<u128> = ArrayTrait::new();
```
"
"How can one access elements from an array in Cairo?","To access array elements, you can use get() or at() array methods."
"In the context of array methods, how does using 'arr.at(index)' compare to another method?","Using arr.at(index) is equivalent to using the subscripting operator arr[index]."
"When the get function finds an element in the array, what does it return in terms of its data type?","The get function returns an Option<Box<@T>>, which is an option to a Box type containing a snapshot to the element at the specified index if that element exists in the array."
"What is the default response of the get function if an array element doesn't exist?","If the element doesn't exist, get returns None."
"In situations where indices may not be within an array's bounds, why would someone opt for the get method?","This method is useful when you expect to access indices that may not be within the array's bounds and want to handle such cases gracefully without panics."
"When referring to the 'at' function, what action does the 'unbox()' operator perform?","The unbox() operator is used in the at function to extract the value stored in a box."
"Consider the function: 'fn main() { let mut a = ArrayTrait::new(); a.append(0); a.append(1); let first = *a.at(0); let second = *a.at(1); }'. What will the variable 'first' contain?","In the provided code example, the variable named first will get the value 0."
"Based on the same function, what value is assigned to the variable 'second'?","The variable named second will get the value 1."
"Regarding the code: 'fn main() -> u128 { ... match arr.get(index_to_access) {...} ... }', what is the purpose of the match block?","The match block is used to handle the return value of the get() method, either extracting a real value if an element exists at the specified index or panicking if it doesn't."
"Which method should you use if you want to determine the number of elements contained within an array?","To determine the number of elements in an array, use the len() method."
"What specific type of data is returned by the 'len()' method when checking an array's length?","The return type of the len() method is usize."
"How can you identify if an array contains no elements?","You can check if an array is empty using the is_empty() method."
"If an array is void of any elements, what does the 'is_empty()' method return?","The is_empty() method returns true if the array is empty."
"What would be the contrary response of the 'is_empty()' method if an array contains elements?","The is_empty() method returns false if the array is not empty."
"Why would the at function be deemed advantageous in preventing unforeseen behaviors?","Using the at function can prevent unexpected behavior by causing the program to panic if the provided index is out of the array's bounds."
"What happens when you use the 'at' function with an index that doesn't correspond to any element within an array?","A possible result of using the at function with an invalid index is a panic error."
"What primary difference exists between the 'get' and 'at' methods when dealing with indices that are out-of-bounds?","The main difference is that the get method returns None for out-of-bounds indices, allowing for graceful error handling, while the at method causes the program to panic."
"When examining an array's length, what data type can you expect the 'len()' method to return?","The len() method returns data of type usize."
"When wanting to determine if an array is devoid of any elements, which method can assist with this?","The is_empty() method can be used to determine if an array has no elements."
