"How is functionality blueprints specified in Cairo?","Functionality blueprints in Cairo are specified using Traits. They include a set of function signatures with type annotations for parameters and return value."
"How do you define a trait in Cairo based on the example given?","To define a trait in Cairo, you use the keyword 'trait' followed by the name of the trait in PascalCase and the function signatures inside curly braces. For example: `trait ShapeGeometry { fn boundary(self: Rectangle) -> u64; fn area(self: Rectangle) -> u64; }`."
"How do you implement a trait in Cairo?","To implement a trait in Cairo, you use the 'impl' keyword with the name of your implementation, followed by 'of' and then the name of the trait being implemented. For example: `impl RectangleGeometry of ShapeGeometry { ... }`."
"Can you provide an example of implementing the `ShapeGeometry` trait for a `Rectangle`?","Certainly, the implementation can look like this: `impl RectangleGeometry of ShapeGeometry { fn boundary(self: Rectangle) -> u64 { 2 * (self.height + self.width) } fn area(self: Rectangle) -> u64 { self.height * self.width } }`."
"What does the #[generate_trait] attribute in Cairo allow you to do?","The #[generate_trait] attribute in Cairo allows you to write implementations directly without defining the corresponding trait. The compiler will automatically generate the trait based on the implementation."
"How should you name your trait when using the #[generate_trait] attribute?","When using the #[generate_trait] attribute, you should add 'Trait' as a suffix to your trait name because the compiler creates the trait by adding a 'Trait' suffix to the implementation name."
"What's the significance of the `self` parameter in the methods of the `ShapeGeometry` trait?","The `self` parameter allows the implemented functions to be attached to the instances of the type as methods. This means the functions can be called directly on instances of the struct they're implemented for."
"Describe the two ways to call the `area` method from the `ShapeGeometry` trait based on the example provided.","The `area` method from the `ShapeGeometry` trait can be called in two ways: 1) as a method on the struct instance, like `rect.area()`, and 2) from the implementation, like `RectangleGeometry::area(rect)`."
"What's the main difference between the initial `ShapeGeometry` trait and the generic `ShapeGeometry<T>` trait?","The main difference is that the generic `ShapeGeometry<T>` trait uses a generic type `T`, allowing the trait to be implemented for multiple types, whereas the initial `ShapeGeometry` trait is specifically for `Rectangle`."
"How can you implement the `ShapeGeometry<T>` trait for both a `Rectangle` and a `Circle` struct?","For `Rectangle`: `impl RectangleGeometry of ShapeGeometry<Rectangle> { ... }`. For `Circle`: `impl CircleGeometry of ShapeGeometry<Circle> { ... }`."

"Why might you want to use generic types when defining traits in Cairo?","You might want to use generic types when defining traits in Cairo to allow the trait to be implemented for multiple types, providing flexibility and code reusability."
"How does Cairo's #[generate_trait] attribute simplify trait implementation?","Cairo's #[generate_trait] attribute simplifies trait implementation by allowing developers to write implementations directly without defining the corresponding trait. The compiler then automatically generates the trait based on the implementation."
"In the code, what does `RectangleGeometry of ShapeGeometry<Rectangle>` signify?","`RectangleGeometry of ShapeGeometry<Rectangle>` signifies that the `RectangleGeometry` implementation is implementing the `ShapeGeometry<T>` trait for the `Rectangle` type."
"What does the `use debug::PrintTrait;` line do in the code?","The line `use debug::PrintTrait;` imports the `PrintTrait` from the `debug` module, enabling the use of the `print()` method on supported types in the code."
