"What is the main purpose of the Vote contract in Starknet?","The Vote contract in Starknet is used for registering voters and allowing them to cast their votes."
"given the Vote Contract:How are voters registered in the Vote contract?","Voters are registered through the contract's constructor where their addresses are passed to the _register_voters function."
"given the Vote Contract:How are the voting options represented in the contract?","The voting options are represented by the constants YES and NO, which correspond to the values 1 and 0, respectively."
"given the Vote Contract:How is the state of the contract updated after a voter casts their vote?","When a voter casts their vote, the state of the contract is updated by recording the vote and marking the voter as having voted."
"given the Vote Contract:What prevents a registered voter from voting multiple times in the same proposal?","After a voter casts their vote, they are marked as having voted in the contract's state, ensuring they can't vote again for the same proposal."

"In the Vote contract's constructor, how are votes initialized?","In the constructor, the vote counts (yes_votes and no_votes) are initialized to 0."
"In the Vote contract, how is a vote recorded as YES or NO?","A vote is recorded based on the input value given to the 'vote' function, where 1 corresponds to YES and 0 corresponds to NO."
"given the Vote Contract:What does the InternalFunctions implementation in the Vote contract handle?","The InternalFunctions implementation in the Vote contract handles the registration of voters and initializes their voting status."
