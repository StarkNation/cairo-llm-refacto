You can remove this warning by passing 'verification_mode=no_checks' instead.

/home/pechaut/miniconda3/envs/cairo-llm/lib/python3.9/site-packages/trl/trainer/sft_trainer.py:226: UserWarning: You passed a tokenizer with `padding_side` not equal to `right` to the SFTTrainer. This might lead to some unexpected behaviour due to overflow issues when training a model in half-precision. You might consider adding `tokenizer.padding_side = 'right'` to your code.
  warnings.warn(
You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
/home/pechaut/miniconda3/envs/cairo-llm/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/utils/checkpoint.py:429: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: please pass in use_reentrant=True or use_reentrant=False explicitly. The default value of use_reentrant will be updated to be False in the future. To maintain current behavior, pass use_reentrant=True. It is recommended that you use use_reentrant=False. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
